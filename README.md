## SharePoint Online WebTest Starter Kit

### Background
When I start to use Visual Studio Web Performance Test to do automate test to my SharePoint tenant,
I face a problem. The VsWebTest capture Guids and unable to detect dynamic content properly. 
The main issue especially happens during Authentication process. 
This problem makes my test project is not reusable for other tenant, and I have to records the
steps and recreate the steps from begining everytime I need to create a test.

### Solution
The solution is to decode Authentication process and store in common SpoLogin.webtest. 
Then I can include the SpoLogin.webtest in the begining of every future test for SharePoint.
The SpoLogin.webtest will handle authentication process, and provide authentication cookie 
for the rest of the test.

### Known Issue
1. Login using Microsoft Live is not supported

### Want to help?
Currently I have problem to handle Microsoft Live authentication. The problem due to the dynamic
content of MS Live authentication, which is generated by Javascript directly in the DOM. 
VsWebTest doesn't support dynamic DOM creation, therefore the content for authentication process 
is missing.
If you want to help, please let me know.
